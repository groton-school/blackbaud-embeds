# Bulletin Board Snippets

Snippets that only work on the Bulletin Board of groups and classes

## [redirect](./redirect.html)

Immediately redirect visitors to the bulletin board to another page (for example, the Topics page, hypothetically).

The trick is in the caption of the embed: name it with the URL you would like to redirect to:

```
{{redirect:https://github.com/groton-school}}
```

## [show-all-links](./show-all-links.html)

By default, the Bulletin Board only shows the three most recent links in the Links widget. This snippet clicks the "Show moreâ€¦" button as soon as the page opens, revealing all the links.

## [topic-search](./topic-search.html)

Make your topics searchable by embedding this snippet. It shows all of your topics in a grid (much like the Topics page), but narrows them down by the search query as you type.
